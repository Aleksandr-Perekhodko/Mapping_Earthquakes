# Mapping_Earthquakes

In this project, we used the mapbox API to create a map with earthquake measurements around the world. We used javascipt to program the actual maps and the design and style of the map. The JavaScipt allows us to add in a layers such as the earthquakes, tectonic plates, and major earthquakes. It also allows us to style the map by allowing us to add in a legend for the earthquake measurements. And allows us to let the user decide their color for looking at the maps and style, such as street satelite, and dark. After the logic for javascript is complete, then we work on the index. There isnt much on the index which is a html file, many of the code is the basic title, head, and body tags. Most of the html tags that we use are link tags and script tags they are essential to creating the earthquake map that we can use.
