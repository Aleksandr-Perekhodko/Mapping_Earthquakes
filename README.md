# Mapping_Earthquakes

In this project, we used the mapbox API to create a map with earthquake measurements around the world. We used javascipt to program the actual maps and the design and style of the map. The JavaScipt allows us to add in a layers such as the earthquakes, tectonic plates, and major earthquakes. It also allows us to style the map by allowing us to add in a legend for the earthquake measurements. And allows us to let the user decide their color for looking at the maps and style, such as street satelite, and dark.
